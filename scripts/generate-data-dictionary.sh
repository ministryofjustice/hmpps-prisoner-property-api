# Exports the prisoner property schema as a flat CSV data dictionary.
#
# The descriptions come from the COMMENT ON statements in db/migration/V15__schema_comments.sql, so this
# is the same source of truth as the SchemaSpy report. The sensitivity classification is pulled out of
# the trailing [Sensitivity: ...] tag on each column comment into its own column, and stripped from the
# description so the text reads cleanly. The output is intended for the MOJ Data Catalogue / AWS Glue.
#
# Usage:
#   scripts/generate-data-dictionary.sh [output-file]
#
# Expects a database built by Flyway. Connection details are taken from the environment, defaulting
# to the container in docker-compose-schema-spy.yml:
#   DB_HOST (localhost) DB_PORT (5432) DB_NAME (prisoner_property) DB_USER (prisoner_property)
#   DB_PASSWORD (prisoner_property) DB_SCHEMA (public)

-- constraint_name and schema - so two tables carrying a same-named constraint match each other, the
-- query fans out, and columns are both duplicated and mis-keyed. This schema declares no explicit
-- constraint names today, so the generated ones are table-prefixed and nothing collides; the bug
-- fires silently the first time a migration adds a duplicate name. It has already happened
-- elsewhere: hmpps-incentives-api had incentive_level_fkey on two tables and published 48 rows
-- instead of 42. pg_constraint carries conrelid, the owning relation, so it cannot collide. Do not
